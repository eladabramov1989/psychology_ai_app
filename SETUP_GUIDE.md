## 🔧 Next Steps Required

### 1. Firebase Configuration (Required for Authentication)

#### Option A: Set up Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project named "MindCare AI" or similar
3. Enable Authentication with Email/Password
4. Enable Firestore Database
5. Download configuration files:
   - `google-services.json` for Android
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS

#### Option B: Continue with Mock Mode
- The app will work in demo mode without Firebase
- All authentication will use mock responses
- Perfect for development and testing

### 2. OpenAI Integration (Optional)

#### For Real AI Responses:
1. Get an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Add it to `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
```dart
static const String openAiApiKey = 'your-api-key-here';
```

#### For Demo Mode:
- The app already includes realistic mock responses
- Dr. Sarah will provide sample therapy conversations
- Perfect for demonstrations and development
